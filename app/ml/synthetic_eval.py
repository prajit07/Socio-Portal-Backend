"""Synthetic evaluation of the classification system (local model + pipeline).

Covers what evaluate_classification.py misses:
  Set A — fresh template samples (different seed than training) -> local.predict()
  Set B — hand-written natural problems (non-template phrasing) -> local.predict()
  Set C — Set B through full categorize() with per-call path + latency report

Honesty notes: Set A shares templates with training data (template fit only).
Set B entered training (weighted) — inflated. Set D (held-out, never
trained) is the honest signal.

Run: python -m app.ml.synthetic_eval [--n 5] [--skip-pipeline]
